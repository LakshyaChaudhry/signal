# Signal v0.1 - Elegant Landing Page ✅

All features have been successfully implemented! The landing page now has a clean, centered hero design with subtle animations and scroll-reveal functionality.

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Hero Timer (Centered & Responsive)
- **Component**: `components/HeroTimer.tsx`
- Responsive font sizes: 96px (mobile) → 120px (tablet) → 144px (desktop)
- **Displays seconds** in HH:MM:SS format
- Subtle pulse animation when timer is running
- Shows either timer time (when running) or total signal time
- Smooth fade-in + scale entrance animation

### 2. Hero Action Buttons
- **Component**: `components/HeroActions.tsx`
- Two buttons side by side: **"START FOCUS"** and **"ADD LOG"**
- START FOCUS button uses signal blue (#0EA5E9)
- ADD LOG button uses neutral border styling
- Staggered fade-in animations (200ms, 300ms delays)
- Hover scale effects for tactile feel

### 3. Daily Progress Bar
- **Component**: `components/DailyProgressBar.tsx`
- Horizontal bar showing **color-coded time blocks**
- Uses 5-level quality system (deep/focused/neutral/distracted/wasted)
- Shows wake time on left, current time/sleep time on right
- Blocks slide in from left with staggered animation
- Compact 40px height below buttons

### 4. Day Status Bar (Top)
- **Component**: `components/DayStatusBar.tsx`
- Minimal 32px height bar at very top
- Shows: "TODAY" (or date) + wake time + "→ ONGOING"/"sleep time"
- Subtle entrance animation
- Only visible when day exists

### 5. Scroll Detection & Layout
- **Hook**: `lib/use-scroll.ts`
- Detects scroll position (considers "scrolled" after 80vh)
- Returns `isScrolled` boolean for layout changes
- Passive scroll listeners for performance

### 6. Sticky Header (When Scrolled)
- **Component**: `components/StickyHeader.tsx`
- Appears when user scrolls past hero (80vh)
- Shows compact timer (no seconds), logo, and timer controls
- Fixed positioning with smooth slide-down animation
- Includes pause/resume and stop buttons when timer running

### 7. Progressive Disclosure
- **Above fold**: Hero timer + buttons + progress bar (centered, full viewport)
- **Below fold**: Log history and timeline (revealed on scroll)
- Fade-in animation for details section
- "↓ SCROLL FOR DETAILS" indicator at bottom of hero

### 8. Responsive Design
- Mobile (<640px): 96px timer, stacked buttons if needed
- Tablet (640-1024px): 120px timer, side-by-side buttons
- Desktop (>1024px): 144px timer, max-width containers
- All layouts use clamp() for smooth scaling

## 🎨 Design Features

### Hero Section (Above Fold)
- **Centered layout** with generous whitespace
- **Huge timer** as focal point (up to 144px)
- **Clean button pair** for primary actions
- **Progress bar** for quick visual summary
- **Minimal distractions** - only essentials visible

### Animations
- Hero timer: fade + scale (0.8 → 1.0, 600ms)
- Buttons: staggered fade-in (200ms, 300ms delays)
- Progress bar: slide up (400ms delay)
- Timer pulse: continuous glow when running
- Scroll reveals: smooth fade + opacity

### Scroll Behavior
- **Hero stays** until 80% scroll
- **Sticky header appears** smoothly from top
- **Details fade in** as user scrolls
- **Timer shrinks** to compact format (no seconds)
- **Smooth transitions** throughout

## 🚀 How It Works

### Initial Load
1. Day status bar appears at top (if day exists)
2. Hero timer fades in with scale animation
3. Buttons stagger in below timer
4. Progress bar slides up from bottom
5. Scroll indicator appears if there are entries

### User Interactions

**Starting Focus:**
1. Click "START FOCUS"
2. Timer begins counting (with seconds)
3. Pulse animation activates
4. Draft entry created in database

**Scrolling Down:**
1. At 80vh scroll, sticky header slides in
2. Details section (timeline + log history) fades in
3. Sticky header shows compact timer + controls

**Adding Manual Log:**
1. Click "ADD LOG" (always visible)
2. Full-screen modal opens
3. Quality dropdown, timestamps, etc.
4. Submit adds to timeline

## 📊 Layout Hierarchy

```
Above Fold (100vh):
├── Day Status Bar (32px) - "TODAY 9:30am → ONGOING"
├── Hero Timer (centered, huge) - "00:45:32"
├── Action Buttons - [START FOCUS] [ADD LOG]
├── Progress Bar - [color-coded blocks]
└── Scroll Indicator - "↓ SCROLL FOR DETAILS"

Sticky Header (when scrolled):
├── Logo "SIGNAL"
├── Compact Timer "00:45"
├── Controls [⏸] [⏹ STOP]
└── Version "v0.1"

Below Fold (revealed on scroll):
├── Section Title - "TODAY'S LOG"
├── Timeline View - full timeline visualization
└── Log History - detailed entry list
```

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **Centered hero design** - timer is the star  
✅ **Responsive scaling** - looks great on all devices  
✅ **Seconds display** - shows HH:MM:SS when timer running  
✅ **Smooth animations** - subtle and elegant throughout  
✅ **Progressive disclosure** - details hidden until scroll  
✅ **Sticky header** - compact view when scrolled  
✅ **Clean button labels** - "START FOCUS" instead of "START TIMER"  
✅ **Color-coded progress** - 5-level quality system  
✅ **No clutter above fold** - only essentials visible  

## 🔄 Removed from Landing

- ❌ Old LiveTimer component (bottom-left)
- ❌ Old "NEW LOG ENTRY" button (bottom-right)
- ❌ DaySelector component
- ❌ Immediate timeline/history visibility
- ❌ Header clutter

These are now either integrated into the new design or revealed on scroll.

## 📝 Copy Changes

- "START TIMER" → **"START FOCUS"**
- "NEW LOG ENTRY" → **"ADD LOG"**
- "PRODUCTIVITY TRACKING V2" → **"v0.1"**
- Added "SCROLL FOR DETAILS" indicator
- Added "TODAY'S LOG" section title

## 🎨 Animation Timings

- Hero timer entrance: 600ms
- Button stagger: 200ms, 300ms
- Progress bar: 400ms delay
- Pulse animation: 2s loop
- Scroll reveals: 400ms
- All use ease-out curves

## 💡 Technical Notes

1. **useScrollPosition** hook uses passive listeners for 60fps scrolling
2. **isScrolled** threshold set at 80vh to trigger layout change
3. **HeroTimer** accepts `isCompact` prop for sticky header
4. **AnimatePresence** used for smooth enter/exit of sticky header
5. **clamp()** CSS function for fluid responsive scaling
6. All components use **Framer Motion** for animations

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

The elegant landing page is complete. Here's what to do:

1. **Refresh the browser**: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **See the hero**: Huge centered timer with seconds
3. **Click START FOCUS**: Timer begins tracking
4. **Watch animations**: Pulse effect on running timer
5. **Scroll down**: Sticky header appears, details fade in
6. **Add entries**: See progress bar populate with colors

The design is clean, minimal, and focuses entirely on the timer as the hero element!
